Hey,

As I had some time to spare, I decided to update the site a little.
Now I have my publications up there (still considering how should I present pre-prints...) and my own domain. I am writing this with the expectation that it won't be read, but it is good practice to put some thoughts down.

I am pretty content with the site right now, just missing a feature
to link to my older blog posts in other sites in the same feed. Of
course the styles tend to change according to my mood.

This spring has been rather special with the fully remote mode and
everything being closed. Thankfully everyone close has stayed healthy. I started studying officially at UTU (again) at the beginning of the year. So far so good: the courses and research have
been interesting, and some progress is being made. My schedule is rather full -- there is no limit to the time I _could_ spend on school, but I have kept some balance with days off. Work schedule is not stressful right now so that is a plus, but it is building up to a end-of-the-year big bang.

Three topics I think I should write about in near future:

- a review of Hugo/netlify
- a review of remote working
- post my spring course notes

(Those at least feel useful so it's a good excuse to procrastinate on actual studies)
