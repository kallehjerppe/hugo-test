Starting from the beginning of this year, I left Geniem. I was recruited to The Hospital District of Southwest Finland (VSSHP), as an ICT-architect for a year-long project.

A lot to learn and more responsibility. Not been overwhelmed so far! We're trying to improve the e-services of the hospital district and
to be ready for the possible new SOTE laws. Instead of just complaining about taxes, let's see if I can help in a small corner... We'll see: there are many moving parts still and lot to define. Working with different vendors and navigating overlapping projects. So far no coding,
I'll have to avoid getting too rusty. Signed up for leetcode, hah.


Missing the people in Geniem and I hope to do things with them in the future as well, but no regrets. I'll update after the year to see if I'm done with the public sector or not. So far I'm excited about the work and the people.

Best!
