# Personal home page with Victor Hugo and Netlify

Forked from a project originally designed and developed by [Darin Dimitroff](http://www.darindimitroff.com/), [spacefarm.digital](https://www.spacefarm.digital). The entire site is pretty much redone.

Now this serves as my [home page](http://www.kallehjerppe.com/) content.
The pipeline is git push -> netlify builds hugo -> static html.
